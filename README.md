## AirLink: Autonomous Airspace Management System

AirLink is an intelligent airspace management platform for drones and eVTOLs, designed to ensure safe, efficient, and optimized navigation in urban environments. The system enables real-time tracking, ML-based path optimization, and collision avoidance using Flask, Leaflet.js, and Machine Learning.

---

## Technologies Used

* Flask (Python) – Backend framework
* Leaflet.js – Interactive map visualization
* Machine Learning – Safe flight path prediction and conflict resolution
* SQLite / JSON – Data storage and management
* HTML, CSS – Frontend interface

---

## Features

* Real-time drone tracking on an interactive map
* ML-based safe path prediction and optimization
* Automated conflict detection and collision avoidance
* Multi-drone coordination with time-aware rerouting
* Scalable backend for real-time decision-making

---

## How It Works

1. Drones send flight data (position, velocity, timestamp) to the **Flask backend**.
2. The backend’s **ML model** predicts safe, efficient paths and detects potential conflicts.
3. Paths are visualized on the **Leaflet map** for real-time monitoring.
4. When a conflict is detected, the system triggers **automated rerouting** to prevent collisions.
5. Multiple drones are coordinated dynamically using **time-aware scheduling**.
